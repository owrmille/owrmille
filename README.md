I’m a Master student in the Computational Sciences program at **FU Berlin**, and I also study at **42 Berlin**, a project-based school with no teachers or traditional classes. 

Currently learning **Java** and exploring **Spring**; practicing algorithms and data structures.

Here are some **projects** that I enjoyed and that challenged me (**C** language):  

- 🎮 [**so_long**](https://github.com/owrmille/so-long) – My first 2D graphical game (that was just simple and pure excitement) 
- 🌐 [**cub3d**](https://github.com/owrmille/cub_3d) – A graphical program involving raycasting (how can maths be so awesome?)  
- 🖥 [**minishell**](https://github.com/owrmille/minishell) – A mini version of a bash-like shell (tested me a lot, but I loved it more than anything!)  
- 🧠 [**philosophers**](https://github.com/owrmille/philosophers) – A problem involving threads, concurrency, data races, and deadlocks (broke my brain. I survived, ha!)  


🌱 I’ve realized I really enjoy working on group projects - feel free to reach out if you're up for teaming up on something. 


**I’m addicted to exploring new and challenging myself!**
